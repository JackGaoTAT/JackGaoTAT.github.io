<p>"Devil May Cry 5" is an action-adventure game developed by Japan's CAPCOM. It is the sixth part of the "Devil May Cry" series, and is the orthodox sequel to "Devil May Cry 4". The story takes place after "Devil May Cry 4". , released on March 8, 2019, for PC, PS4 and XBOX One.</p>
<p>The game plot is set for a large number of demons in the city, and players need to play the role of the game to participate in the confrontation [4] . The game is developed using Capcom's proprietary RE engine, which makes the game reach a new height in terms of graphic fidelity. The plot of "Devil May Cry 5" is set after the story of "Devil May Cry 4". The protagonist returns, and a mysterious new character "V" is also added. A giant tree rose into the sky in the center of the city, and the citizens gathered to watch, amazed. "Intelligencer" Morrison looked at the giant tree and prayed to himself: "We've known each other for so long... This is the first time such a big trouble. This time you have to get through it well, Dante." Here Dante did encounter When it comes to big trouble, even the battle-hardened legendary demon hunter is helpless in the face of an unprecedentedly powerful demon. At this time, Nero also came to help Dante. Mysterious Man V told Nero, never underestimate this demon, that it took Nero's right arm and gained extraordinary power from it.</p>
<p>Nero follows the most classic gun and sword combined fighting style, and the biggest improvement of the game lies in the "mechanical arm". Different types of robotic arms can play different roles in combat. Dante's fighting style also inherits the basic settings of the previous game: the four forms that can be flexibly switched and the styles formed by their unique moves are ever-changing. V's fighting style is so unique that even veterans of the series take a while to get used to</p>
