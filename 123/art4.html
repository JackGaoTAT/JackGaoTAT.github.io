"The orthodox sequel. The game tells the saga of Arthur Morgan and the infamous Van der Linde gang, and takes players on a desperate journey across America in the final years of the 19th century.</p>
<p>United States, 1899. The last twilight of the Wild West era comes when the police begin to crack down on the gang of remnants of outlaws. Those who are unwilling to surrender or give in have no other choice but to die. Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang have to flee the western town when a heist in Blackwater encounters an unexpected surprise. With federal detectives and the nation's top bounty hunters chasing after them, Arthur and his party must loot and struggle to survive in the vast and wild American heartland. The contradictions and divisions within the gang are deepening day by day, and Arthur will be faced with an unavoidable choice: whether to choose his own ideal, or choose to be loyal to the gang that raised him</p>
<p>Weapons in the game are divided into firearms, bows, throwing weapons and melee weapons, each with different performance in terms of damage, range, rate of fire, accuracy and reload speed. Most of the weapons and ammunition can be purchased in the gun shop. The weapons that players can buy will increase with the progress of the plot. Some special weapons need to be found by the player or obtained by completing specific tasks. Every time a player uses a weapon, the durability value of the weapon will be consumed, and various attributes of the weapon will also decrease with the consumption of the durability value. Players can customize the weapon, the metal, wood, varnish and engraving of the weapon can be customized in terms of appearance, and the barrel, grip, sight and scope can be upgraded in terms of performance</p>
